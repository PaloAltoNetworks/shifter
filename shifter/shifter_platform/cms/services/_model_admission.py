"""CMS launch-boundary required-model admission gate (PLAT-202, #2119).

Every range launch — cold participant/spare/wave/standalone/recovery-rebuild and
warm-claim activation — funnels through ``_create_raes_native_range_impl``. This
gate runs there, before any dispatch, so required model access is enforced
uniformly across every launch family. It is deliberately distinct from the
best-effort PLAT-201 capacity path: a required-model denial or indeterminate
outcome fails the launch closed instead of proceeding.

CMS owns scenario hydration and egress posture (it resolves the scenario need
projection and maps the egress mode); the Engine owns the authoritative
fail-closed decision, folding deployment policy and the #2139/#2140 sharing
overlap. A scenario with no authored need — or only optional needs that resolve
to visible absence — passes through unchanged.
