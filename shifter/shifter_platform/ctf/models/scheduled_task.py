"""CTFScheduledTask — the one-shot scheduled-automation row for CTF events.

Extracted from ``ctf/models/notification.py`` (#2099) to keep each model file
under the python:S104 file-size budget after the claim-fencing methods were added.
The model stays in the ``ctf`` app with its existing ``ctf_scheduled_task`` table,
and ``ctf/models/__init__.py`` re-exports it, so ``from ctf.models import
CTFScheduledTask`` keeps working unchanged and no migration is needed.
