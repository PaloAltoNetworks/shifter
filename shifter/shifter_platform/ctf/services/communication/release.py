"""Intent release for scoped communications (ADR-051, #2048).

Releasing a campaign resolves the audience server-side and, in ONE locked
transaction, writes the immutable intent, the deterministic per-recipient
snapshots and in-app receipts, the initial per-channel delivery commands, and a
strict audit event. PostgreSQL is authoritative; nothing calls a transport
before commit.

Release is linearized against cancellation and fencing: it takes the campaign and
target-event row locks, re-checks the campaign/event fences and resolves
recipients INSIDE the transaction, and its idempotency identity is scoped to the
immutable campaign so a replay can never return another campaign's intent. A
retry collapses onto the same intent, and per-recipient uniqueness means it can
never grow the audience (AC2, AC3).

The RAES/range-source reference columns on ``CommunicationIntent`` are populated
by the later RAES/range-ingress slices; this slice releases manual and
event-scoped campaigns and carries only the range-generation fence.
