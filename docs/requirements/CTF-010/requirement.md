# CTF-010: Scheduled Tasks & Automation

## Statement

The CTF layer should automate time-sensitive event operations, such as range provisioning, resource cleanup, and state transitions, using the platform's scheduler framework (see CTF-1001). Events run reliably without requiring organizer presence at exact moments.

## Rationale

CTF events have time-bound lifecycles that require actions at specific moments, ranges must be ready before start, torn down after end, reminders sent in advance. Manual execution is error-prone and requires organizer availability at exact times. CTF registers its task types with the platform scheduler rather than building its own automation infrastructure.

## Traceability
