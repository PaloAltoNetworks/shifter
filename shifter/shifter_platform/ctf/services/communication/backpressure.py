"""Admission backpressure for scoped communications (ADR-051-R12, #2098).

Two complementary controls, because a rate counter alone cannot bound a durable
backlog:

* fixed-window abuse limits (per actor, per workspace, global) via the shared,
  atomic ``consume_fixed_window`` primitive; and
* a durable outstanding-work reservation (per event, per workspace, global) counted
  from the ledger and serialized against concurrent admissions with a per-workspace
  PostgreSQL advisory lock, plus a fan-out (audience-size) cap checked before any
  acceptance is reported.

Enforcement is fail-closed: an over-budget request raises a bounded
``CTFCommunicationError`` and emits a closed-label denial metric; it never silently
downgrades or partially admits. The typed, relationally-validated owner of the
numeric knobs is ``config._ctf_communication_settings``; the ``getattr`` defaults
here keep the module importable and unit-testable.
