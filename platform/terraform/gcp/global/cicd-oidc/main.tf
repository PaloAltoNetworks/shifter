# Foundational GitHub Actions -> GCP OIDC/WIF identity root (issue #615 follow-up).
#
# The WIF pool/provider and purpose-scoped service accounts are the identities
# CI authenticates as. They must OUTLIVE the platform: a
# `gcp-dev-destroy` tears down the platform-core root, and the subsequent CI
# rebuild has to authenticate (via this WIF) to run at all. So this identity
# lives in its own Terraform root with a state prefix separate from the platform
# root -- exactly like platform/terraform/gcp/global/github-runner -- and the
# platform destroy never touches it. This matches the README "Fresh GCP Account
# Order" step 2, where WIF is configured before (and independently of) the
# platform deploy.
#
# The network-coupled packer build-infra (builder subnet, IAP firewall, image
# bucket) stays in the platform-core root because it depends on the platform VPC
# and Cloud NAT; it references this SA by its deterministic email.
