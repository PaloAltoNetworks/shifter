"""Retry-safe range launch: bind a caller retry key to one launch operation.

#2086, ADR-063. A public caller supplies a retry key so a lost launch response can
be recovered without a duplicate launch. Recovery is looked up and projected from
the *bound* request/operation (never the caller's current active range) and does
not recompile or re-validate the caller's original selections against today's
catalog, so a replay recovers even after the scenario or agent is retired. First
use dispatches the normal RAES create path and binds the key to the resulting
request/operation generation and the caller's normalized intent; a replay with a
different caller intent conflicts before any effect (``RetryKeyConflict`` -> 409).

The digest covers only the caller-controlled selections (action, actor, workspace,
scenario, agent selection); the compiled-plan half of the immutable-intent binding
is enforced by the engine's ``OperationInput`` and its re-enqueue comparison.

This orchestration lives in the CMS layer because it owns ``create_range_dispatch``;
it reaches the retry-binding primitives only through the ``engine.services`` facade
(ADR-001).
